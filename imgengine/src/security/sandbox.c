/*
 * SANDBOX POLICY
 *
 * The seccomp filter is the last line of defense against
 * decoder exploits that attempt syscalls (shell, network, etc).
 *
 * DEV MODE: disabled by default to allow full engine startup.
 *           Enable IMG_SANDBOX_ENABLED=1 in production.
 *
 * PRODUCTION: enable only AFTER engine is fully initialized.
 *             Call img_security_enter_sandbox() after:
 *               - slab pools allocated (mmap done)
 *               - threads created (clone done)
 *               - files opened (openat done)
 *               - io_uring initialized (io_uring_setup done)
 *             Then lock down. Decoder runs under the filter.

 *
 * IMPORTANT: call img_security_enter_sandbox() AFTER full engine
 * initialization — after threads, slabs, io_uring, and file handles
 * are all set up. The filter locks down the decoder only.
