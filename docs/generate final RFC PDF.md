### ?? RFC: imgengine v1.0 (FINAL)

    Title: High-Performance, Kernel-Grade Image Processing Engine
    Author: Principal Engineer (L7)
    Status: Final Draft
    Date: 2026-03-30

## 1. ?? Overview

    1.1 Problem Statement

    Existing tools (e.g., ImageMagick):

    unpredictable latency (heap fragmentation)
    scalar execution (no SIMD batching)
    unsafe parsing (RCE risk)
    not optimized for SaaS multi-tenancy
    1.2 Goal

    Build a deterministic, SIMD-accelerated, zero-allocation image engine with:

    sub-2ms latency per 4K image
    100K+ ops/sec throughput
    kernel-grade memory safety
    predictable performance (P99 stability)
    1.3 Non-Goalscli
    Not GPU-first (CPU optimized first)
    Not UI-based
    Not general-purpose editor

## 2. ?? SLO / KPIs

    Metric Target
    P50 Latency < 1 ms
    P99 Latency < 2 ms
    Throughput 100K ops/sec
    Error Rate < 0.01%
    Allocations 0 in hot path

## 3. ?? High-Level Architecture

    Client (FastAPI / Go)
            ?
    Bindings (CFFI / CGO)
            ?
    imgengine Core
            ?
    Pipeline Engine (Jump Table)
            ?
    SIMD Execution (AVX2 / AVX-512 / NEON)
            ?
    Output Buffer

## 4. ? Execution Model (Kernel-Grade)

    Worker-per-core architecture
    CPU affinity (thread pinning)
    Lock-free SPSC queues
    Batch processing (32–128 images)
    Why:
    eliminates contention
    maximizes cache locality
    predictable latency

## 5. ?? Memory Model (CRITICAL)

    5.1 Slab Allocator
    pre-allocated at startup
    thread-local arenas
    fixed-size blocks
    5.2 Guarantees
    ? No malloc/free in hot path
    ? Zero fragmentation
    ? Constant-time allocation (O(1))
    5.3 Advanced (Kernel-grade)
    HugePages support
    pre-faulted memory pages
    lock-free freelists
    zero-copy buffer reuse

## 6. ?? Data-Oriented Design (DOD)

    Structure of Arrays (SoA)
    64-byte cache-line alignment
    stride-aware image layout
    Optimized for:
    AVX2 / AVX-512
    CPU cache efficiency
    sequential memory access

## 7. ?? Plugin System (VTable Dispatch)

    Design
    static registration at startup
    function pointers in jump tables
    no runtime symbol lookup (dlsym)
    Benefits
    O(1) dispatch
    branch prediction friendly
    ultra-low latency
    ABI Contract
    strict versioning (v1, v2…)
    fixed struct layouts
    capability flags

## 8. ?? NUMA-Aware Design

    per-NUMA-node memory pools
    threads pinned to NUMA nodes
    avoid cross-node memory access
    Result:
    reduced latency spikes
    improved memory locality

## 9. ?? CPU Cache Strategy

    64-byte alignment (cache line)
    prefetching (__builtin_prefetch)
    avoid false sharing (padding)
    contiguous memory layout

## 10. ?? Latency Budget (Per Image)

    Stage Budget
    Decode 0.5 ms
    Dispatch 0.2 ms
    SIMD Processing 0.8 ms
    Output Write 0.3 ms
    Total < 2 ms

## 11. ?? Security Model

    Threats
    malicious images
    buffer overflows
    decoder exploits
    Mitigation
    bounds-checked parsing
    fuzz testing (LibFuzzer)
    ASAN / UBSAN in CI
    sandboxed decoder layer

## 12. ? Failure Handling

    Scenario Strategy
    Corrupt input Fail-fast
    SIMD unsupported Scalar fallback
    Plugin crash Skip + log
    Memory exhaustion Reject request

## 13. ?? Backpressure & Load Control

    bounded queues
    drop policy (fail-fast)
    adaptive throttling

## 14. ?? Observability

    Metrics
    P50 / P99 latency
    throughput
    error rate
    Logging
    lock-free ring buffer
    async flush
    Tracing
    OpenTelemetry hooks

## 15. ?? Deployment Model

    Docker containers
    stateless nodes
    horizontal scaling
    Optimization
    ARM (NEON) support (cost-efficient)
    CPU-based scaling

## 16. ?? Testing Strategy

    unit tests
    integration tests
    fuzz testing
    performance benchmarking (P99 focus)

## 17. ?? Failure Injection (Chaos)

    corrupt input simulation
    memory exhaustion tests
    queue overflow tests
    SIMD fallback validation

## 18. ?? Sequence Diagram

    Client ? API ? Binding ? Core
    Core ? SPSC Queue ? Worker (Pinned CPU)
    Worker ? Pipeline Engine ? Jump Table
    Jump Table ? SIMD (AVX2/AVX-512)
    SIMD ? Output Buffer ? Client

## 19. ?? Risks & Mitigation

    Risk Mitigation
    SIMD complexity scalar fallback
    plugin instability strict ABI
    memory bugs slab + ASAN

## 20. ?? Future Work

### 21. ?? Repository & Folder Structure (Kernel-Grade)

## 21.1 Design Philosophy

    The repository is structured based on:

    Separation of Concerns (SoC)
    Hot vs Cold Path isolation
    Hardware abstraction boundaries
    Stable API vs Internal Implementation split

    ?? Rule:

    Anything in api/ is stable
    Anything in src/ can evolve aggressively

    4. No cache-line sharing
    5. No unpredictable branches

## 22. ?? Releases & CI/CD (Production-Grade)

## 22.1 ?? Release Strategy (GitHub Releases)

    Versioning Scheme

    We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
    Type Meaning
    MAJOR Breaking ABI/API changes
    MINOR New features (backward compatible)
    PATCH Bug fixes / optimizations
    Release Types
    Release Description
    Stable Production-ready
    RC (Release Candidate) Pre-production validation
    Nightly Auto-built from main branch
    Release Artifacts

    Each release must include:

    Static library (libimgengine.a)
    Shared library (libimgengine.so)
    Header bundle (api/)
    Benchmark report (P50/P99 latency)
    Checksums (SHA256)
    Example GitHub Release Structure
    imgengine-v1.0.0/
    +-- lib/
    ¦   +-- libimgengine.so
    ¦   +-- libimgengine.a
    +-- include/
    ¦   +-- api/
    +-- benchmarks/
    ¦   +-- perf_report.txt
    +-- checksums.txt
    Release Rules
    ? No breaking ABI without MAJOR bump
    ? All releases must pass CI + benchmarks
    ? Tag-based releases only (v1.0.0)

## 22.2 ?? CI Pipeline (Continuous Integration)

    Goals
    Ensure correctness
    prevent regressions
    enforce kernel-grade constraints
    CI Stages
    1. Lint & Formatting
    2. Build (Multi-arch)
    3. Unit Tests
    4. Integration Tests
    5. Fuzz Testing
    6. Performance Benchmarks
    7. Security Scan
    CI Workflow (GitHub Actions)
    name: imgengine-ci

    on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:

    jobs:
    build-test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Install deps
            run: sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake

        - name: Build
            run: |
            mkdir build && cd build
            cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
            make -j$(nproc)

        - name: Run Tests
            run: ./tests/run_all.sh

        - name: Run Benchmarks
            run: ./scripts/bench_perf.py

        - name: Fuzz Testing
            run: ./scripts/fuzz_test.sh

## 22.3 ? Performance Gate (CRITICAL)

    CI must fail if:

    P99 latency > 2ms
    Throughput drops > 5%
    Memory allocation detected in hot path

    ?? This ensures performance never regresses

## 22.4 ?? Security Pipeline

    Tools
    AddressSanitizer (ASAN)
    UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSAN)
    Fuzzing (LibFuzzer)
    Policy
    - Every PR must pass fuzz tests
    - No undefined behavior allowed
    - All inputs must be validated

## 22.5 ?? Multi-Architecture Builds

    We support:

    x86_64 (AVX2 / AVX-512)
    ARM64 (NEON)
    Matrix Build
    strategy:
    matrix:
        arch: [x86_64, arm64]

## 22.6 ?? CD Pipeline (Continuous Deployment)

    Flow
    Commit ? CI Pass ? Tag Release ? Build Artifacts ? Publish ? Deploy
    Release Automation Workflow
    name: release

    on:
    push:
        tags:
        - 'v*'

    jobs:
    release:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Build Release
            run: |
            mkdir build && cd build
            cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
            make -j$(nproc)

        - name: Package
            run: |
            mkdir release
            cp build/libimgengine.so release/
            cp -r api release/include

        - name: Create Release
            uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
            with:
            files: release/*

## 22.7 ?? Observability in CI/CD

    Store benchmark history
    Track latency trends over time
    Alert on regression

    ?? Optional:

    Grafana dashboards
    Prometheus integration

## 22.8 ?? Pre-Merge Requirements

    Every PR must:

    ? Pass all tests
    ? Pass performance gate
    ? Pass fuzz/security checks
    ? Be reviewed (at least 1 senior engineer)
    22.9 ?? Kernel-Grade CI Rules
    ? No untested code merges
    ? No performance regressions
    ? No unsafe memory patterns
    ? Deterministic builds
    ? Reproducible artifacts
    ? Verified binaries
    ?? Principal-Level Insight

    This pipeline ensures:

    Code quality stays high
    Performance never degrades
    Security is continuously validated
    Releases are reproducible and safe

    ?? This is how production systems are maintained at
    Google / Amazon scale.

### FOR ME ?? Why this matters for YOU

	You’re already working on:
     system design
     microservices
     performance (VPP-style thinking)
     That’s exactly the path toward L7

 To reach this level, you need to master:

     distributed systems
     performance engineering
     system architecture (like kernel-grade design you asked earlier)
